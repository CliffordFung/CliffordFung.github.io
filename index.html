						Hi there!
						Welcome to my portfolio page, my name is Clifford Fung and I am a passionate software engineer.
						It began in grade 12 when I had to decide what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
						Without much prior knowledge, I chose engineering solely because the title sounded cool.
						In my first year, I took my very first computer programming course and was exposed to the world of coding.
						I fell in love with it right away and pursued my undergraduate degree in a Bachelor's of Applied Sciences with a major in Computer Engineering.
						With the endless possibilities in developing creative, innovative and 
						I am dedicated in my work, always strive for high quality content,
